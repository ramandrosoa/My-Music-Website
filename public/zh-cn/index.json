This avoidance reflects how inhibition works: it buries the truth beneath layers of hesitation. Throughout the opening section, the melody primarily lies low, thick with muted tones, as if afraid to be heard. Once the music finally settles into B minor, a gradual transformation occurs: the dynamics begin to swell, and the melody ascends into a higher register.

In this modulation, the new melody provides a sense of emotional comfort to help feel secure despite the shift in the musical landscape. From there, it rises again—modulating to E major, momentarily revisiting the harmonic color of the introduction, as if the wave were pulling back before its final surge.

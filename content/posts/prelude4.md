## Description

  "What Ifs" is a quiet meditation on uncertainty, where each phrase seems to question itself. <br>
  The melody moves with a fragile hesitance, as if caught in a cycle of imagining how things might have been. <br>
  <br>
  The main melody is followed by a lower melodic phrase that acts as a response, like inner voices that is trying to comfort the internal conflict. <br>
  <br>
 A brief modulation to the key of D major occurs midway through the piece, offering a short-lived contrast in color and character. This tonal shift introduces a brighter harmonic context, which can be interpreted as a moment of clarity or reassurance. <br>
 <br>
 However, the modulation is not sustained; the music soon returns to E minor, reinforcing the original introspective state and leaving the emotional tension largely unresolved.

## Description
This piece began as an improvisation on “Mary Had a Little Lamb” and features two voices representing the characters Mary and Jo. <br>
<br>
It opens in E major and moves through modulations to A minor, then to A major, where a solo passage emerges—Mary sings alone. <br>
Jo then enters, attempting to imitate Mary but with his own voice, modulating to D major and creating a playful dialogue. <br>
<br>
The piece gently returns to its home key of E major, bringing the musical conversation to an unified close.

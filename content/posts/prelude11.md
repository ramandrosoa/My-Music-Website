## Description

This prelude is a personal interpretation of “Iny hono izy ravorombazaha” (Great white bird), a traditional Malagasy lullaby. <br>
In the song, parents call upon a bird to carry the crying child far into the sky—returning only once the child is calm and ready to sleep.<br>
<br>
The piece begins with quiet chords, setting a gentle, hushed atmosphere. <br>
Rather than bringing the melody to the forefront, I chose to layer it into the middle register, mainly played by the thumbs. <br>
The left and right hands wrap around it gently, like arms cradling a child, echoing the gesture of lulling a baby. <br>
<br>
I wrote this piece during a time when I was struggling to fall asleep. For reasons I couldn’t always explain, sleep wouldn’t come easily—so I spent those nights working on my music, shaping pieces like this prelude. Somehow, I realized I was the one I was trying to soothe.

## Description

The prelude begins with a hushed stillness, though its calm already suggests the storm to come. <br>
The opening motif soon returns more forcefully in octaves, while the accompaniment stirs restlessly with repeated notes that climb upward, intensifying the agitation. 
<br>
<br>
In the central section, the mood turns brighter through modulations to B major, then A major and G major, before the music swells to its climax and finally returns to the turbulent home key of Gâ™¯ minor.

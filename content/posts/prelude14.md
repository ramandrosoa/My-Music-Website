## Description
Built on two successive gestures—a bass melody and its echoing arpeggios—the piece contrasts weight and lightness.  <br>
<br>
Each bass note falls with the gravity of a stone, while the arpeggios ripple outward like circles on water. <br>
<br>
Though dynamically restrained, shifting harmonies color the texture with constant tension and release.

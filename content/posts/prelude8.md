## Description
Inspired by the Armored Titan’s formidable presence in Attack on Titan, this composition emphasizes percussive weight and density.<br>
<br>
His massive, unstoppable form inspired the use of dense, powerful chords that push both the instrument and the performer. It’s physically demanding—like struggling against a wall. <br>
<br>
The melody is bold and dramatic, capturing the might and the emotional weight behind Reiner’s struggle.

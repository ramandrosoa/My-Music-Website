## Description
Songs whose lyrics we’ve forgotten, melodies we hum without thinking. This prelude was born from that space.<br>
<br>
Its chord progression draws subtle inspiration from "One Summer’s Day" by Joe Hisaishi, the iconic theme from Spirited Away: bringing a warm, nostalgic atmosphere reminiscent of childhood memories. <br>
<br>
Both hands move in unison, echoing each other in a continuous fluid motion, gently repeating a phrase that feels like “Lalala”—as if the piano itself is humming a tune it once knew.

## Description

The piece is divided into two parts: Drowning and Diving.<br>
<br>
Drowning opens the work with a sense of struggle — gasping right-hand figures imitate air bubbles, while the left hand sinks inexorably downward.<br>
<br>
In contrast, Diving marks a modulation to a lighter D major. The music becomes still, curious, and open, as if descending freely into the unknown. Quiet chords suggest the calm of underwater exploration.<br>
<br>
The piece ends on an A minor chord with an augmented fourth. The texture grows lighter, rising in shimmering gestures — a nod to Scriabin’s Fifth Sonata. These final figures suggest a distant light flickering far above, barely visible through the deep.

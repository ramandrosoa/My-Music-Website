## Description

Like waves rolling onto the shore, this prelude unfolds with a surface that seems repetitive and calm, yet beneath it lies constant variation and subtle unpredictability. <br>
The main melody, while appearing simple and recurring, reveals delicate shifts and surprises with each phrase. <br>
<br>
 The piece opens unexpectedly with an E major chord, quickly settling into D major where the main melody is introduced, before drifting into the C minor key. <br>
 In this modulation, the new melody provides a sense of emotional comfort to help feel secure despite the shift in the musical landscape. <br>
 <br>
 From there, it rises again—modulating to E major, momentarily revisiting the harmonic color of the introduction, as if the wave were pulling back before its final surge. Eventually, the music returns home to D major, completing its cyclical journey. <br>
 <br>
 Throughout, the left hand’s ascending and descending arpeggios gently imitate the natural motion of waves—rising, falling, retreating—creating a flowing undercurrent that drives the piece forward.

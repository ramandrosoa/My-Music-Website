## Description

My first composition, Fairy Tale in E Major, tells a small story of innocence and longing. <br>
<br>
It opens in E major with a wandering melody that sounds like a child’s daydream—pure, unguarded, and full of imagination. As the music travels through the keys of C major and F major, it drifts into other worlds.<br>
<br>The second theme, in D minor, brings a quiet loneliness, its calm surface slowly stirring into motion. <br>
<br>
After reaching its emotional peak, the music finds its way back through the keys of E-flat major and B major, before returning to the warmth of its home key, E major—like waking from a dream.

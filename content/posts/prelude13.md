## Description

The piece begins with a light, flowing motif, always returning with subtle differences, like leaves stirred in the wind, each one distinct yet connected. <br>
<br>
Building steadily, it modulates into E♭ major, where a descending figure suggests leaves drifting gently to the ground. The music then surges back toward F♯ major, where the cycle begins anew.

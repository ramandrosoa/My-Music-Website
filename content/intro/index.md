title: "About Me"

---

Hello, my name is Minah Ramandrosoa. I’m a self-taught composer and pianist based in Madagascar.<br>
<br>
My journey in music began in 2018, when I was 18, after watching the anime Your Lie in April. What started as curiosity quickly grew into something deeper. I became fascinated by Chopin’s music and dreamed of playing his First Ballade, even though at the time I only owned a five-octave keyboard and had very little technical knowledge.<br>
<br>
Aware of how demanding classical music can be—especially for someone starting later—I began cautiously. I taught myself basic theory, learned pop songs, and gradually developed an intuitive sense of harmony and chord progression.<br>
<br>
At first, music was simply something I loved.<br>
Then I discovered Bach’s Goldberg Variations.<br>
<br>Perhaps it was the genius of Bach’s counterpoint, but this piece made me feel as though there isn’t only one way to live. It made me realize that something essential had always been missing from my life and encouraged me to question ideas I had long accepted. Since then, there hasn’t been a single day I haven’t felt grateful for being guided toward classical music.<br>
<br>
Music, to me, is not entertainment—it is a way of thinking, questioning, and understanding the world.<br>
<br>
By the end of 2019, I acquired an upright piano and began exploring the instrument more seriously. While I still dreamed of playing Chopin’s Ballade No. 1, being self-taught made me cautious. Studying and memorizing demanding works helped me develop dexterity and musical awareness, even when the results were imperfect. As my schedule became increasingly busy, the rare moments I had at the piano felt too precious to waste on routine practice alone.<br>
<br>
That’s when composing began to take shape.<br>
<br>
At first, it was instinctive—letting my hands fall naturally on the keys, without much concern for structure. Gradually, it became more intentional. After many attempts, I completed my first piece that felt truly meaningful to me, Fairy Tale, in late 2024.<br>
<br>
Since then, I’ve been working on a larger Fantaisie, a set of preludes in all 24 keys inspired by Chopin and Scriabin, and more. Each piece feels like an extension of a thought, an emotion, or a question I couldn’t express in any other way.<br>
<br>
Composing has become how I structure my thoughts and channel my inner world. There is nothing more fulfilling to me than bringing to life music that once existed only in my imagination. By sharing my music, I hope to encourage others to approach music with curiosity and depth.<br>
<br>
I’m still learning.<br>
Still questioning.<br>
And still listening.<br>

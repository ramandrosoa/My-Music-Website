title: "About Me"

---

I’m a data consultant based in Madagascar with a deep passion for classical music. 
Since 2018, I’ve been on a self-taught journey in music, gradually and consistently learning to express myself through the piano. Over time, this path has led me to composing my own pieces.

I feel deeply grateful to have found, in the piano, a perfect medium to channel my thoughts and feelings. It’s a gift I cherish every day—being able to sit down, let my hands fall naturally on the keys, and experience the pure joy of creating something meaningful. Music has become a quiet refuge, and I never take for granted the peace and clarity it brings.

By sharing my compositions, I hope to spark curiosity and inspiration—inviting others to discover the beauty of classical music, just as I did.

Among the many great composers, I find deep inspiration in the works of Alexander Scriabin, Frédéric Chopin, and Johann Sebastian Bach. Their music continues to shape my understanding of harmony, emotion, and artistic expression.
